## Video Outline

The video runs 42 seconds and divides into three acts that mirror how a developer would actually use Amazon Q.

### Act 1: Setting the Stage (0:00–0:12)

| Beat | Time | Scene Name | What Happens |
|------|------|------------|--------------|
| **1.1** | 0:00–0:03 | **Intro** | Title card: "Building dbt Packages with AI" in orange on navy |
| **1.2** | 0:03–0:07 | **VS Code Overview** | Full VS Code with project folders and Amazon Q icon highlighted |
| **1.3** | 0:07–0:12 | **Zoom to Chat** | Zoom into chat panel; welcome message appears |

The video opens with bold Amazon Q branding, transitions into the VS Code environment showing the dbt healthcare project structure, then zooms smoothly toward the Amazon Q chat panel. The file explorer fades as the welcome message appears, building anticipation for the demonstration.

### Act 2: The Demonstration (0:12–0:24)

| Beat | Time | Scene Name | What Happens |
|------|------|------------|--------------|
| **2.1** | 0:12–0:16 | **Attach Context** | Close-up: three context files appear with spring animations |
| **2.2** | 0:16–0:24 | **Type Prompt** | Close-up: typing animation shows full prompt with cursor |

This is the heart of the video. We cut to a dramatic full-screen close-up as context files pop onto screen one by one: architecture spec, Data Vault patterns, coding standards. Then the typing begins—large, readable text flows as the user composes their prompt requesting dbt packages for claims, providers, members, and groups. The "Send to Amazon Q" button appears, ready to dispatch.

### Act 3: Results and Payoff (0:24–0:42)

| Beat | Time | Scene Name | What Happens |
|------|------|------------|--------------|
| **3.1** | 0:24–0:30 | **Agent Working** | Progress animation: 6 steps, files appearing with checkmarks |
| **3.2** | 0:30–0:34 | **Files Created** | VS Code file explorer shows 6 new files with "NEW" badges |
| **3.3** | 0:34–0:38 | **Benefits** | Four bullet points: speed, consistency, patterns, documentation |
| **3.4** | 0:38–0:42 | **Call to Action** | "Try Amazon Q Developer Today" button |

Amazon Q springs into action with animated progress steps and file creation. We return to VS Code to admire the results—six new files with glowing badges. The video closes with four benefit bullets and a clear call to action.

## Scene Breakdown

### Intro Scene
**Beat 1.1 · Timeline: 0:00–0:03 (3 seconds)**

The video opens on a dark navy background with the title "Building dbt Packages with AI" rendered in Amazon's orange brand color. Below it, a subtitle reads "Amazon Q Developer in VS Code." The text fades in with a subtle animation, establishing the professional tone and Amazon Q branding that will carry through the video.

This scene serves as the video's handshake with the viewer—immediately answering "what is this about?" before diving into the demonstration. The color scheme (orange on dark navy) matches Amazon Q's official branding and creates strong visual contrast for readability.

---

### VS Code Overview Scene
**Beat 1.2 · Timeline: 0:03–0:07 (4 seconds)**

The scene transitions to a full-screen mock of Visual Studio Code. The interface shows a project called "dbt_healthcare_project" with both the Amazon Q chat panel on the left and a file explorer on the right. The file explorer displays a typical dbt folder structure: a top-level project folder containing models, raw_vault, and business_vault subdirectories.

The Amazon Q icon in the activity bar is highlighted, drawing the viewer's eye to the AI assistant that will power the upcoming demonstration. This establishing shot orients viewers who are familiar with VS Code and introduces the project context before any action begins.

---

### Zoom to Chat Scene
**Beat 1.3 · Timeline: 0:07–0:12 (5 seconds)**

A smooth zoom animation draws the viewer's focus to the Amazon Q chat panel. The file explorer fades from view as the camera settles on the chat interface. Amazon Q's welcome message appears: "Hello! I'm Amazon Q Developer. I can help you generate code, explain existing code, or work on complex tasks across your codebase. How can I help?"

This transition builds anticipation. The zoom creates a sense of "getting closer" to the action, while the welcome message introduces Amazon Q's voice and capabilities. The five-second duration gives viewers time to read the message and mentally prepare for the demonstration.

---

### Attach Context Scene
**Beat 2.1 · Timeline: 0:12–0:16 (4 seconds)**

The view cuts to a dramatic full-screen close-up—the VS Code chrome disappears entirely, leaving only the Amazon Q interface against a deep blue background. The header shows the Amazon Q Developer logo and branding.

Three context files appear in sequence, each with a spring animation that makes them "pop" onto screen:
- **architecture_spec.md** appears at the 1-second mark
- **data_vault_patterns.md** appears at the 2-second mark  
- **dbt_coding_standards.md** appears at the 3-second mark

Each file displays as a prominent blue badge with a pin icon, clearly communicating that these documents are being attached as context for the AI. The staggered timing emphasizes that this is a deliberate action—the user is carefully selecting the right context to guide Amazon Q's output.

### Type Prompt Scene
**Beat 2.2 · Timeline: 0:16–0:24 (8 seconds)**

The close-up continues as the user begins typing their prompt. The text appears in a large, monospace font against a dark text box, making every character clearly visible. A blinking orange cursor follows the typing animation.

The full prompt reads: *"Using the attached architecture spec and context documents, create a complete set of dbt packages for our Data Vault implementation. Include raw vault hubs and links for claims, providers, members, and groups entities. Follow our coding standards and naming conventions."*

The typing is paced at approximately 2 frames per character—fast enough to maintain energy, slow enough for viewers to read along. All three context files remain visible above the prompt, reinforcing that this request is grounded in specific documentation. An orange "Send to Amazon Q" button appears once typing is underway, ready to submit the request.

This is the video's centerpiece moment: a clear demonstration of how to craft an effective prompt by combining context documents with specific requirements.

### Agent Working Scene
**Beat 3.1 · Timeline: 0:24–0:30 (6 seconds)**

The view shifts to an agent progress screen showing Amazon Q actively processing the request. The header reads "Amazon Q Developer - Working on your request..." with a task description: "Creating Data Vault dbt packages for healthcare payer domain."

Six progress steps appear and animate through their states:
1. ✓ Analyzing architecture specification...
2. ✓ Reading Data Vault patterns from context...
3. ○ Generating hub models for core entities...
4. ○ Creating link models for relationships...
5. ○ Building staging models with coding standards...
6. ○ Generating schema.yml documentation...

On the right side, a "Files Being Created" panel shows files appearing with checkmarks: hub_claim.sql, hub_provider.sql, hub_member.sql, hub_group.sql, and more. A counter at the bottom tracks progress: "4 / 8 files created."

This scene creates excitement by showing the AI actively working. The animated progress indicators and file creation give viewers a sense of momentum and capability.

### Files Created Scene
**Beat 3.2 · Timeline: 0:30–0:34 (4 seconds)**

The view returns to VS Code, now showing the fruits of Amazon Q's labor. The file explorer is prominently displayed with six newly created files, each marked with a green "NEW" badge:
- hub_claim.sql
- hub_provider.sql
- hub_member.sql
- hub_group.sql
- link_claim_provider.sql
- schema.yml

A gentle zoom toward the file explorer (1.2x) draws attention to the new files. The Amazon Q chat panel remains visible on the left, showing the conversation that produced these results.

This scene delivers the payoff: tangible files that the developer can immediately use. The "NEW" badges create visual celebration of the accomplishment.

### Benefits Scene
**Beat 3.3 · Timeline: 0:34–0:38 (4 seconds)**

The scene transitions to a clean bullet-point slide summarizing the key benefits. The title reads "Why Use Amazon Q for dbt?" followed by four value propositions:

- ⚡ Accelerate development with AI-generated boilerplate
- 📋 Consistent code following your standards
- 🏗️ Data Vault patterns applied automatically
- ✅ Schema documentation generated

Each bullet animates in with a slight delay, creating a staggered reveal that maintains viewer attention. The emoji icons add visual interest and help viewers quickly scan the benefits.
