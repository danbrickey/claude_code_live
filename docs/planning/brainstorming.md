# Planning Brainstorming

A living document for capturing ideas during Planning Increment (PI) sessions. Ideas are rough-sized as **Epics**, **Features**, or **Stories** before being formalized in the planning system.

## Current PI Context

**Sprint Cadence:**
- **Duration:** Sunday → Saturday (1 week sprints)
- **Sprint Planning:** Sunday morning (plan the week ahead)
- **Development:** Primarily weekends + weeknights
- **Sprint Wrap-up:** Saturday (complete stories, prep for planning)

**PI Goals:**
- (Add current PI goals here)

**Active Focus Areas:**
- (What are we prioritizing this increment?)

| **Feature** | Medium, fits in one PI | 2-4 weeks | "Add theme customization system" |
| **Story** | Small, specific task | 1-5 days | "Change app theme to dark mode" |

**Fibonacci Sizing:** 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 (21 = needs breakdown)

## 🚀 Epic-Sized Ideas

*Big work that spans multiple Planning Increments*

### [Epic Idea Title]

**What:** Brief description of the big initiative

**Why:** Business value or user problem it solves

**Rough Size:** (e.g., "3 months", "2 PIs")

**Dependencies:** What needs to happen first?

**Next Steps:** Should we create an epic doc?

### [Feature Idea Title]

**What:** Description of the feature

**Why:** Value it delivers

**Rough Size:** (e.g., "3 weeks", "13 story points")

**Belongs To:** Which epic does this support?

**Next Steps:** Ready to break down into stories?

## ✅ Story-Sized Ideas

*Small, specific tasks ready to be worked*

### [Story Idea Title]

**Rough Size:** (e.g., "3 days", "5 story points")

**Belongs To:** Which feature or epic?

**Next Steps:** Ready to add to current PI?

## 🅿️ Parking Lot

*Ideas that need more discussion before sizing*

- **Idea:** (Brief description) - *Needs: (what's blocking sizing?)*
- **Idea:** Research features in [tool/technology] - *Needs: spike to understand scope*
- **Idea:** Create lead magnet landing page - *Needs: decide which lead magnet*

## How to Use This Document

1. **During PI Planning:** Capture ideas as they come up
2. **Rough Size:** Assign Epic/Feature/Story category based on scope
3. **Discuss:** Add context about why, value, dependencies
4. **Graduate:** When ready, use Planning Assistant to create formal epic/feature/story docs
5. **Archive:** Move completed brainstorming sessions to bottom, keep document fresh

**Integration with Planning Assistant:**
- Brainstorm here → Create epic with `/epic create`
- Feature ideas → Break down with `/feature create`
