# Claude Code Webinar Notes

## Three Types of Projects to Start With

This diagram categorizes beginner-friendly project types for Claude Code into three main columns based on complexity and backend requirements.

### What Separates These Categories?

The progression from left → right represents increasing complexity based on:
- **Authentication** — user login/identity management
- **Database** — persistent data storage
- **APIs & Integrations** — connecting to external services

| Category | Auth | Database | APIs/Integrations |
|----------|------|----------|-------------------|
| Static Pages | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Apps / Games | Sometimes | Sometimes | Sometimes |
| Automations / Agents | Often | Often | ✓ Required |

---

### 1. Static Pages — No Backend
*Simplest category: pure frontend, no server logic needed*

| Project Type |
|--------------|
| Artifacts |
| Landing Pages |
| Research Doc |
| Visualization |
| Slide Deck |
| PDFs / Documents |
| Company Voting Apps |
| Event Pages |
| Company Dashboard |

**Key insight:** These are great starting points because they require no backend infrastructure—just HTML/CSS/JS that can be opened directly in a browser.

---

### 2. Apps / Games
*Interactive applications with more complex state and logic*

| Project Type |
|--------------|
| Games |
| Education |
| Web Apps |
| Web Apps with AI APIs |
| Personalized Chatbot |
| Notes App |
| Schedule Apps (Project Management) |

**Key insight:** These involve more interactivity and state management. AI API integrations (like chatbots) are highlighted as accessible options.

---

### 3. Automations / Agents
*Background processes and integrations that run autonomously*

| Project Type |
|--------------|
| Email Automation |
| Slack Bot |
| Claude SDK Agent |
| Scheduled Research Bot |
| Email Marketing Bot |

**Key insight:** These projects typically run headlessly or integrate with external services. They represent a step toward building autonomous AI-powered tools.
